## Directories

### 0x00-python-hello_world

This directory contains introductory projects focused on understanding the basics of Python programming. The tasks cover fundamental concepts such as printing text, using comments, and handling errors.

### 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions

This directory focuses on control flow in Python, including if-else statements, loops, and functions. The tasks are designed to help users understand and practice writing conditional statements, loops, and defining functions.

### 0x02-python-import_modules

This directory covers the use of modules and packages in Python. It includes tasks on how to import and use modules, as well as how to create your own modules.

### 0x03-python-data_structures

This directory introduces data structures in Python, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. The tasks are designed to help users understand and practice using these data structures effectively.

### 0x04-python-more_data_structures

This directory continues the exploration of data structures in Python, with a focus on sets and advanced dictionary operations. The tasks are designed to deepen the understanding of data manipulation and storage.

### 0x05-python-exceptions

This directory covers exception handling in Python. It includes tasks on how to handle errors gracefully using try-except blocks and how to raise exceptions.

### 0x06-python-classes

This directory introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. The tasks cover the basics of defining classes, creating objects, and using methods and attributes.

### 0x07-python-test_driven_development

This directory focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python. It includes tasks on writing tests using the `unittest` module and developing code that passes the tests.

### 0x08-python-more_classes

This directory continues the exploration of OOP in Python, with more advanced topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### 0x09-python-everything_is_object

This directory covers the concept that everything in Python is an object. The tasks are designed to help users understand the object model and how to manipulate objects.

### 0x0A-python-inheritance

This directory focuses on inheritance in Python. It includes tasks on how to create subclasses, override methods, and use the `super()` function.

### 0x0B-python-input_output

This directory covers file input and output (I/O) in Python. The tasks include reading from and writing to files, as well as working with JSON data.

### 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle

This directory contains a comprehensive project that brings together various Python concepts, including OOP, file I/O, and testing. The tasks involve creating a set of classes that model geometric shapes and performing operations on them.

### 0x0D-SQL_introduction

This directory introduces SQL and database management. The tasks cover basic SQL operations such as creating databases, tables, and performing queries.

### 0x0E-SQL_more_queries

This directory continues the exploration of SQL with more advanced queries and database management tasks. It includes topics such as joins, subqueries, and constraints.
