# Project: 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This directory contains projects focused on understanding and implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The tasks cover creating classes, defining methods, using attributes, and understanding the principles of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
